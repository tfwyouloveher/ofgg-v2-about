# OFGG v2

### The second iteration of the Online Frozen Gif Generator

A modern from-scratch update of the original Online Frozen Gif Generator, which was a
[warmly received](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frozen/comments/3ymbov)
2015 solo project by a younger and far more naÃ¯ve myself.

Unfortunately, the sources for the original have been completely lost to the sands of time,
but thankfully a helpful user (shoutout to u/Demian_Dillers) submitted a screenshot of how it looked on their machine:

### Version 1 (ca. 1997, colorized):

### Not great.

Users had to download the movie file separately. It was not at all mobile-friendly.
There was no preview function, no fps or subtitles options, and worst of all:
*it was entirely written in PHP*. ðŸ˜“

## Presenting Version 2:

#### A complete rewrite, v2 promises the features that v1 so desperately lacked:

- Mobile-first, modern design
- Live preview of the movie clip, allowing for scrubbing to the desired timestamp
- FPS and subtitle configurability
- In-browser gif preview generator, prior to full-size gif creation on server
- Completely written in Javascript, using Node.js and React ðŸ˜Ž
- Gif preview *fully encodes* a new gif file *in-browser*, using a custom cutting-edge WebAssembly solution ðŸ¤¯

#### What's next:

- Allow users to download movie files to their browser so app can be used offline (using ServiceWorker)
- Let users select which movie file to use for local preview, exchanging quality for disk space themselves
- Add other Frozen media, e.g. the short films, trailers, and upcoming sequel ðŸ¥°
