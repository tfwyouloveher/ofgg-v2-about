### The second iteration of the Online Frozen Gif Generator

A modern from-scratch update of the original Online Frozen Gif Generator, which was a
[warmly received](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frozen/comments/3ymbov)
2015 solo project by a younger and far more naÃ¯ve myself.

Unfortunately, the sources for the original have been completely lost to the sands of time,
but thankfully a helpful user (shoutout to u/Demian_Dillers) submitted a screenshot of how it looked on their machine:

### Version 1 (ca. 1997, colorized):

### Not great.

Users had to download the movie file separately. It was not at all mobile-friendly.
There was no preview function, no fps or subtitles options, and worst of all:
*it was entirely written in PHP*. ðŸ˜“

## Presenting Version 2:

#### A complete rewrite, v2 promises the features that v1 so desperately lacked:

- Mobile-first, modern design
- Live preview of the movie clip, allowing for scrubbing to the desired timestamp
- FPS and subtitle configurability
- In-browser gif preview generator, prior to full-size gif creation on server
- Completely written in Javascript, using Node.js and React ðŸ˜Ž
- Gif preview *fully encodes* a new gif file *in-browser*, using a custom cutting-edge WebAssembly solution ðŸ¤¯

#### What's next:

- Allow users to tweak gif size/quality options
- Add other Frozen media, e.g. the short films, trailers, and sequel ðŸ¥°
- Fix "Delete" button on media; it properly deletes downloads but the "free space" indicator doesn't reflect it until much later

## Okay, so how do I use it?

tl;dr: Select your source file in the sidebar, change the gif options to how you want, and click Generate. For an HD copy, you can then click Upload.

Thorough version:

1. Open the sidebar on the left and select a movie file to save. This will be the source file for the gifs you make!
2. After you click "download", it'll load for a minute (just be patient) and then you'll see an "Open" option. Click it.
3. Now, close the sidebar, and you'll see your movie file playing, with some options below it. You can adjust the starting time by scrubbing the video, or by changing the text field below. Additionally, you can change the duration (down to tenths of a second), the framerate, the resolution, and the inclusion of subtitles in those options as well.
4. Now you can click "Generate Gif" to create your very own, one-of-a-kind Frozen gif!
5. If you need to adjust the duration or any other options, you can click Start Over to try again. Otherwise, you can click Upload to send the gif options to the server, and in a few seconds, you'll receive an HD copy of your same gif!
6. To save your gif, right click it and select "Save". If you're on mobile, press and hold the gif image instead of right-clicking.

That's it! Head on over to [frozengifs.com](https://frozengifs.com) and get giffing!
